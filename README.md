# sherpa-parts
This is a repo of common pieces that will be used as a submodule in multiple repos

## Purpose
All of this used to be in the [Sherpa](https://github.com/agims/sherpa) repo but we are working on making it more modulular as we are starting to create templated theme repos based off of it as well.  The decision was made to move all of the non-standard WordPress files into this repo and treat it as a submodule.  So here we are!
